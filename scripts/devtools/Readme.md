Simple scripts to easier mess up the dev server
-----------------------------------------------

The scripts are symlinked in /usr/local/sbin so they are easily invoked from anywhere.

The scripts' names are pretty straightforward. Use \[tab\]\[tab\] or \[tab\] to select them faster.

For example, type **cps** then \[tab\]\[tab\] will show you what scripts start with that name.
